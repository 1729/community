    I've built a fun, NFT PFP version of a network state that is 1729-aligned
    where we have a constitution and everything. Got some 1729 frens there too.
    Still pretty early stages, so free NFTs for anyone in 1729 that DMs me
    and wants to be a part of this.

    Our veteran, venture-backed team of game developers from Riot Games
    (League of Legends) is building a Web3 game aka digital nation called
    Everseed. We drew inspiration from Axie Infinity, but my background
    as a virtual economist will allow us to actually create a sustainable
    game & economy that will not rely on ponzi-nomics. We already have 35K
    followers on Twitter: https://twitter.com/playeverseed

    My LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/kliuless

    I’ve been in 1729 since lecture #2 and have loved every one of @balajis’s
    lectures — they have really helped shape my perspective on our company
    & product strategy.

    We believe an immersive game experience is the key to fostering early
    culture for digital nation-building.
