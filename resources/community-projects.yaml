    I've built a fun, NFT PFP version of a network state that is 1729-aligned
    where we have a constitution and everything. Got some 1729 frens there too.
    Still pretty early stages, so free NFTs for anyone in 1729 that DMs me
    and wants to be a part of this.

    Our veteran, venture-backed team of game developers from Riot Games
    (League of Legends) is building a Web3 game aka digital nation called
    Everseed. We drew inspiration from Axie Infinity, but my background
    as a virtual economist will allow us to actually create a sustainable
    game & economy that will not rely on ponzi-nomics. We already have 35K
    followers on Twitter: https://twitter.com/playeverseed

    My LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/kliuless

    Iâ€™ve been in 1729 since lecture #2 and have loved every one of @balajisâ€™s
    lectures â€” they have really helped shape my perspective on our company
    & product strategy.

    We believe an immersive game experience is the key to fostering early
    culture for digital nation-building.

    Working on build_republic here.  Also a digital-first network state
    concept except instead of crowdfunding new land, our domain will be
    existing cities and ideally improving them.  Hence the build_[city]

    I'm involved the user research side of RnDAO:

    Our mission is to empower humane collaboration.

    We believe the future of DAO tooling is collaborative. The projects that
    thrive will be those that work together with their ecosystem, creating
    composable and modular products, reducing the duplication of work, sharing
    the cost and benefits of research, and helping each other grow and thrive.

    From this thesis, we've developed the idea for a DAO innovation center,
    funded by DAOs to serve DAOs, with a mandate to ship research and tools
    that make DAO operations easier, thus facilitating mainstream DAO adoption.

    We're calling it RnDAO, which stands for Research and Development DAO,
    by DAOs, for DAOs.
